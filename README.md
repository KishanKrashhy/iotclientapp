# Web Application
The choice of building a web application was with the purpose of demonstrating a web application developement. I am also able to create a client side CLI REST application using nodejs. The web Apllication is just to demonstrate my work with front-end. I can also work on react-redux but with the time limit I decided to build the app in core React. If needed I can also create a CLI bases nodejs client app and the complete implementation of the react-redux framwork.
